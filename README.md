# Calculating Multidimensional Volumes Using Monte Carlo Method
The jupyter notebooks ('multidimensional_volumes_MC.ipynb' and'multidimensional_volumes_MC_2.ipynb') show two different ways of implementing a Monte Carlo algorithm to determine the unit volume of a hypersphere (or ball) of dimension D.

The first implementation ('multidimensional_volumes_MC.ipynb') is a straightforward one, but computationally less efficient (time- and memory- wise). The second implementation ('multidimensional_volumes_MC.ipynb'), however, is well optimized, thus way more efficient than the first implementation. The user may see the executime times if the notebooks are run in VS Code.
